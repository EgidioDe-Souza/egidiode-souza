      <p class="p-3">Hi Everyone, my name is Egidio De-Souza. I have a degree in Business With Mandarin, and I have been working in the international educational sector for the past three years. At the beginning of last year, 
         I was a Sales and Admissions Advisor for an small independent school. 
         Unfortunately, this industry struggled to cope during the pandemic and as a result I was made redundant from my job in September 2020. I used this setback as an opportunity to upskill myself, volunteered as a business advisor, and learn more about the technology industry. 
         Through this a love for programming was discovered, and I undertook various courses on Python, SQL, HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I attended a 9-week full-timeintensive coding bootcamp learning HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript ES6,
         SQL, git, GitHub, Heroku and Ruby on Rails. Designed, implemented and shipped to
         production a clone of AirBnB.
